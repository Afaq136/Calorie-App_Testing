## App Overview

The Calorie App is intended to display a list of all of the food the user answered yes to consuming as well as the total amount of calories the user will be intaking. 

### Description 

**The Calorie App will fetch data such as the food image, food name, and the amount of calories the food contains from a Food API. The App will ask the user if they would like to consume the food being displayed. If the user answers yes, the food will be added in a RecyclerView. At any time the user can click the end button which will be available towards the bottom of the page. Once the user clicks end, the application will display a RecycleView which contains all of the food the user answered yes to.**
